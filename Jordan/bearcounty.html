    <h2>Grizzly Bear</h2>

                The grizzly bear, also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly, is a population or subspecies 
                of the brown bear inhabiting North America. Although variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is 
                typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back. Although grizzlies are 
                of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of 
                both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, 
                white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears, though they are more likely to take calves and 
                injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those 
                with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. 
                Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals.

    <h2>Black Bear</h2>

                The American black bear or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's 
                smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly 
                depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of 
                food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. Despite the name, 
                some subspecies can be brown or even blond in coloration. The Asian black bear, also known as the Asiatic black bear, 
                moon bear and white-chested bear, is a medium-sized bear species native to Asia that is largely adapted to an arboreal 
                lifestyle. It lives in the Himalayas, southeastern Iran, the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, 
                the Korean Peninsula, northeastern China, the Russian Far East, the islands of Honshū and Shikoku in Japan, and Taiwan.

    <h2>Polar Bear</h2>

                The polar bear is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. 
                A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. 
                Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, 
                with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and 
                for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.[10] Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most 
                of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. Polar bears 
                hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. 
                Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.

    <h2>Panda Bear</h2>

                The giant panda, also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. 
                It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to
                 distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda 
                 is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will 
                 occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, 
                 they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
