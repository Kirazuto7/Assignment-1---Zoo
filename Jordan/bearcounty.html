                    The grizzly bear, also known as the North American brown bear or simply grizzly, is a population or subspecies 
                    of the brown bear inhabiting North America. Although variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is 
                    typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back. Although grizzlies are 
                    of the order Carnivora and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of 
                    both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, 
                    white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears.Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass.

                    The American black bear or simply black bear, is a medium-sized bear endemic to North America. It is the continent's 
                    smallest and most widely distributed bear species. American black bears are omnivores, with their diets varying greatly 
                    depending on season and location. They typically live in largely forested areas, but will leave forests in search of 
                    food, and are sometimes attracted to human communities due to the immediate availability of food. The Asian black bear, also known as the Asiatic black bear, 
                    moon bear and white-chested bear, is a medium-sized bear species native to Asia that is largely adapted to an arboreal 
                    lifestyle.

                    The polar bear is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. 
                    Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, 
                    with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and 
                    for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most 
                    of their time on the sea ice. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. 
                    Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.

                    The giant panda, also known as the panda bear (or simply the panda), is a bear native to South Central China. 
                    It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to
                    distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda 
                    is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild will 
                    occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, 
                    they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
