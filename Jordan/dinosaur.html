                The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is a genus of large theropod dinosaur.
                Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia.
                yrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but unusually powerful for their size, 
                and they have two clawed digits. It is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the 
                strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was 
                most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and 
                possibly sauropods. T. rex is one of the largest land carnivores of all time. <strong>BE CAREFUL NOT TO GET TOO CLOSE!</strong>

                Velociraptor is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and 
                Achillobator, Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore 
                with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and tear 
                into prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout.

    <h2>Apatosaurus</h2>

                A herbivorous sauropod, Apatosaurus, used its peg-like teeth to strip leaves from trees but not for chewing. 
                It probably swallowed stones in order to grind food in its gizzard. Apatosaurus could whip its tail to defend itself 
                from meat eaters. It measured around 33 tons and was approximately 70 feet long. Apatosaurus used to be known as 
                brontosaurus as a result of a labeling error. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus are less elongated and more heavily 
                constructed than those of Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and the bones of the leg are much stockier despite
                being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal 
                locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb.
