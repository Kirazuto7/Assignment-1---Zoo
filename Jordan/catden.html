                The tiger is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. 
                It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. 
                An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary 
                but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of 
                its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's home 
                range to establish their own.

                The white tiger or bleached tiger is a leucistic pigmentation variant of the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger and hybrids 
                between the two.  It has the typical black stripes of a tiger, but carries a white or near-white coat. 
                The white Bengal tigers are distinctive due to the color of their fur. The white fur caused by a lack of the pigment 
                pheomelanin, which is found in Bengal tigers with orange color fur. When compared to Bengal tigers, the white Bengal tigers 
                tend to grow faster and heavier than the orange Bengal tiger. They also tend to be somewhat bigger at birth, and as fully grown 
                adults.

                The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, 
                deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; 
                adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.
                A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, 
                preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when 
                opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not.

                The liger is a hybrid offspring of a male lion (Panthera leo) and a female tiger (Panthera tigris). 
                The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called 
                the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, 
                and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species.
                Though ligers typically have a life expectancy of between 13 and 18 years, they are occasionally known to live into their 20s.
                Male ligers are consequently sterile, while female ligers are not.
