    The giraffe is a tall African mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. Specifically, It is an even-toed ungulate. It is the 
    tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one species, 
    Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing giraffes into up to eight extant 
    species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other 
    extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.
