    Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. 
    Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping 
    known as paraphyletic; however in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, 
    making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the families of
    New World monkeys (Platyrrhini) and Old World monkeys.
