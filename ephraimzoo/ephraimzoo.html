    <h3>In broad terms, pigs are domesticated hooved mammals with bristly hair, 
            short legs, and curved tails. They are omnivorous, and they use flat snouts 
            to dig through the soil for food. Pigs are typically farmed for their meat, 
            but they have also been kept as pets.</h3>
