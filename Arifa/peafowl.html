      The Indian peafowl (peacocks refer to male peafowls and peahens 
    refer to the females) resides in moist and dry-deciduous forests 
    in the Indian subcontinent, as well as the drier lowlands of Sri Lanka. 
    This bird feeds on fruits, seeds, insects, and even small reptiles and mammals.
