      The Indian peafowl (peacocks refer to male peafowls and peahens 
    refer to the females) resides in moist and dry-deciduous forests 
    in the Indian subcontinent, as well as the drier lowlands of Sri Lanka. 
    This bird feeds on fruits, seeds, insects, and even small reptiles and mammals.
    Males, which have more colorful feathers than the females, employ their 
    decorative plumage in courtship rituals. Not only do the females lack this
    distinctive tail, but they are also smaller in size.
