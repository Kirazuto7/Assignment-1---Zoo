      Also known as the red bear-cat, the red cat-bear and the lesser panda, 
    this small mammal is native to southwestern China and the eastern Himalayas. 
    This animal feeds mostly on the leaves of bamboo, but it also eats fruits, acorns, 
    birds and smaller mammals. With the exception of mating season, red pandas have a solitary lifestyle
    and are difficult to observe in the wild. The main threats to these animals are deforestation and poaching.
    Consequently, the red panda was listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2015.
