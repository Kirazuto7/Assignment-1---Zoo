    Also known as the red bear-cat, the red cat-bear and the lesser panda, 
    this small mammal is native to southwestern China and the eastern Himalayas. 
    This animal feeds mostly on the leaves of bamboo, but it also eats fruits, acorns, 
    birds and smaller mammals.

  <h3>Fun Fact!</h3>
  <h4>Despite its name, the Red Panda is more closely related to racoons than pandas of the white and black variety.</h4>
