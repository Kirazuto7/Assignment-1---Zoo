      The zebra is an African equine distinguished by its 
    black-and-white striped coat. This animal is found in 
    savannahs, grasslands, woodlands and shrublands of eastern 
    and southern Africa. It feeds mostly on grasses, 
    but will also eat buds, fruits and roots. Social behavior differs among zebra species, but mountain
    and plains zebra live in harems consisting of an adult stallion and several mares. Due to their
    hides, these animals are highly vulnerable to poaching.
