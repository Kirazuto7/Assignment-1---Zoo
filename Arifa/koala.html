    The koala is a type of marsupial, which is an animal that 
    gives birth to underdeveloped young. This animal makes 
    its home in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia. 
    It consumes about 500 grams of eucalyptus leaves daily. However, due to the limited
    nutritional value of these leaves, koalas are largely sedentary. Koalas are asocial,
    and bonding is only common among mothers and dependent young. Due to deforestation and
    bushfires, koalas were listed as Endangered in 2022.
